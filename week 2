OVERVIEW

This Python script demonstrates basic list operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding elements in a list.


STEPS PERFORMED

1. Create an Empty List

2. Append Elements

Appends the integers 10, 20, 30, and 40 to my_list.

3. Insert an Element

Inserts the integer 15 at the second position (index 1).

4. Extend the List

Extends my_list with another list [50, 60, 70].

5. Remove the Last Element

Removes the last element in my_list using .pop().

6. Sort the List

Sorts my_list in ascending order.

7. Find the Index of a Value

Finds and prints the index of the value 30 in my_list.


USAGE

Save the script to a file, e.g., list_operations.py.

Run the script with:

python list_operations.py

The output will display the index of the value 30 after all list operations.
